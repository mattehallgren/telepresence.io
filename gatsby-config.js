// Many packages in the build process have built-in sanity checking; we want CI
// to be able to run those checks to catch mistakes.
//
// Many of these packages, such as 'react-dom' and 'gatsby-link' only do that
// sanity checking in NODE_ENV == 'development', or at least NODE_ENV !=
// 'production'.  This is problematic because `gatsby build` forcefully sets
// NODE_ENV='production', and ignores whatever the user actually set NODE_ENV
// to.  And `gatsby develop` doesn't help, because it won't eagerly process
// every page (and even if it did, a lot of the errors would end up in the
// browser console when you go to that page, and not in the terminal).
//
// So, give the user an escape hatch to undo what `gatsby build` did.
